//Space COmplexity

Its the memory space that your programme takes!
Memory dpace depends on system to system!

notation for SC is also Big-Oh notation

Definition: 

Auxilary Space (space that u take to solve the problem)
+
Input Space (Space that u to take the input)

Example(Pseudo=club):

input A and Input B
C=A+B
Auxilary Space: C (If we use extra variable/extra space to solve the problem then that is called auxilary space)
Input Space: A and B are the input Space..

Now SC: O(3)
